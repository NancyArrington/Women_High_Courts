I did not include that information in the flow chart because I don't see how the Supreme Court can try its own members, but I still wanted to mention this.     Lastly, Article 97, Declaration 4 describes how the Senate can create a delegation within its own body to make a judgment and final decision. That seems separate than the Senate deciding itself, so I made this process separate on the flow chart.",1,"Article 97 (2): If the accusation refers to crimes committed in the exercise of their functions or to indignity for misconduct, the Senate cannot impose another penalty than dismissal from employment, or the temporary deprivation or absolute loss of political rights...
